Game written in programming languages Dern and standard C99.

**This project is deprecated**. Please use new and improved 3D version of this
game from inside the Octaspire Dern project. It is written fully in Octaspire Dern.
This project uses also C99. **After it became possible to write the 3D version
of this game using only Octaspire Dern - without help from C - this project
hasn't been updated**.
